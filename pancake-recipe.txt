Ingredients:
 - 2 Eggs
 - 4 tbsp Oil
 - 1 1/2 cup Milk
 - 1/2 cup Greek Yogurt
 - 2 tsp Vanilla Extract
 - 2 cups Flour
 - 1 tbsp Sugar
 - 4 tsp Baking Powder
 - 1/2 tsp Salt

Directions:
 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.
 
 2. In a small bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs and vanilla extract. Pour the liquid mixture into the
 	flour mixture and stir just until combined. Add the yogurt and stir.
 
 3. Head a 12-inch nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat and spray it well with nonstick cooking 		spray. Working in batches, spoon a quarter cup of the batter onto the pan for each pancake and cook 	just until bubbles form around the edges of each pancake, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook for 90 		seconds more. Transfer the pancakes to a warm plate. Repeat with the remaining batter.

 4. Serve the pancakes topped with maple syrup and fruit
